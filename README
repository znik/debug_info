HOW TO USE DEBUG_INFO LIBRARY

1. Launch install.sh.

  It will install libelf-dev and libdwarf-dev packages that are required for the library.

2. Launch Makefile.
  
  It will create a static library.

3. Add reference to the library to your Makefile as follows:

  CXXLIBS += -L. -ldebug_info

4. Add debug_info dependencies to the Makefile *after* -ldebug_info:

  include debug_info.deps

5. Add '#include "varinfo.hpp"' to the file where variable type info is required.

6. The following code will do the job:

 #include "varinfo.hpp"
 ...
 VarInfo vi;
 if (!vi.init(path_to_binary, debug_prefix)) { ... }
 ...
 std::string var_type = vi.type(src_file_path, line_in_file, var_name);

7. To see how everything works, see Makefile.main,

  make -f Makefile.test
  make -f Makefile.main
  ./main test v2 23

8. About paths in pt. 6. (To be improved for better usability)

  * path_to_binary - a relative path to the binary from $PWD (e.g. .libs/libwiredtiger.so)
  * debug_prefix - an absolute path to the makefile that was used to create the binary (e.g. /cs/systems/.../wiredtiger/build_posix)
  * src_file_path - absolute path to a source file that starts with 'debug_prefix' (e.g. /cs/systems/.../wiredtiger/build_posix/../src/async/async_api.c)
